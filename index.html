								<h4>Part of Speech Tagging (POS)</h4>
								<p style="margin-top:-1%">
									(Currently working on it)
								</p>
							</li>
							<div>
								<p><b> Description:</b> Part of Speech is a technique in Natural Language Processing (NLP). 
									POS tries to tag each word in a sentence with the correct part of speech. This is a supervised learning approach.
									Artificial Neural network will be applied to compute POS tagging with great performance. 
									I am planning to use Multi-Layer Perceptron Network which is a very popular network architecture, 
									considered as the state of the art on Part-of-Speech tagging problems.

								<h4>Fashion MNIST - Image Classification</h4>
							</li>
							<div>
								<p><b> Description:</b> Image classification is a very popular problem. Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article 
									imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. 
									Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. We are given the set of images from 
									Fashion MNIST dataset and all are labelled with a category. 
									We are asked to predict these categories for a novel set of test images and measure the accuracy of the predictions.
									Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with three hidden layers has been used to classify this problem.

								<h4>Predict survival on the Titanic</h4>
							</li>
							<div>
								<p><b> Description:</b> Predict survival on the Titanic is a binary classification problem in Machine Learning. 
									Because here the outcome will only be Survived or Not Survived in numerical values it will be 1 or 0. Based on the training
									we have to predict whether the passenger will survive or not. Naive Bayes classifier, Multi-level Perceptron, Randon Forest,
									Linear Regression models were used.

								<h4>5 Layer Security Architecture for Connected Vehicle System</h4>
							</li>
							<div>
								<p><b> Description:</b> Modern vehicles represent a complex
									distributed network of connected hardware and
									software systems, which aim to provide full
									automation to the Connected Vehicles (CV). But
									every IT system that operates via communication
									networks is a subject to potential security
									vulnerabilities. In this project, we team of 5, identified the
									required security and privacy guidelines as well as
									design a security framework to safeguard the
									Connected Vehicles. We aimed to address the many
									challenges of security and privacy risks, which will
									further help to increase the level of confidence and
									trust in connected vehicle systems.

								<h4>RNA Folding with energy minimization</h4>
							</li>
							<div>
								<p><b> Description:</b> RNA molecule which was once consider as the intermediate step between DNA and protein has 
									become one of the important subject of research today. And RNA folding is the most fundamental process 
									which underlying RNA function. RNA folding is simpler. Only four nucleotides, each made of a base, 
									a ribose, and a phosphate, are used as building blocks of the structure but determining the RNA 
									secondary structure from sequence data by computational predictions is a longstanding problem. 
									In our report we team of two had discussed about different algorithm which can be used to determine the RNA secondary structure.

								<h4>Handwriting Recognition using Neural Networks</h4>
							</li>
							<div>
								<p><b> Description:</b> Our project aims was to create a functional neural network architecture for accomplishing 
									the task of handwriting recognition. We designed a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and convolution neural net (CNN) 
									in Keras with TensorFlow in the backend. We used MNIST database for training our models. Further we tested the 
									designed deep learning model and assessed its efficiency using multiple evaluation criteria and visualizations.<br>
